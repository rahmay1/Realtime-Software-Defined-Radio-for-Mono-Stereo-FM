## Real-time SDR for mono/stereo FM and RDS

This project is regarding a software implementation of a software-defined radio (SDR) system for
real-time reception of frequency modulated (FM) mono and stereo audio. The reception of frequencies is
obtained using a combination of a RF dongle on the Realtek TRL 2832U chipset along with a Raspberry
Pi 4. The SDR is created with the use of C++, with python parts for modeling and verification. Visit
the "Doc" folder then "Final Project Report" pdf for more information.
